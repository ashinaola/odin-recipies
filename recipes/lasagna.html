        <!-- Description -->
        <p>
            Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering sheets of pasta with a variety of fillings. 
            Typically, it includes a rich meat sauce (often made with ground beef or sausage), creamy béchamel 
            or ricotta cheese, and a generous amount of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. The layers are baked 
            until bubbly and golden, creating a deliciously hearty and comforting meal.

        <!-- Steps -->
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Prepare the meat sauce:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef and Italian sausage over medium heat until browned.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and cook until the onion is translucent.</li>
                <li>Stir in the tomato sauce, tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and pepper.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Simmer the sauce for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Prepare the cheese mixture:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>In a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, and 2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese. Mix well.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Assemble the lasagna:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
                <li>Place a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce.</li>
                <li>Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles.</li>
                <li>Add another layer of meat sauce over the cheese mixture.</li>
                <li>Repeat the layers (noodles, cheese mixture, meat sauce) until all ingredients are used, ending with a layer of meat sauce on top.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Sprinkle the remaining 2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese and the grated Parmesan cheese over the top.</li>
            <li>Bake:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil (to prevent the cheese from burning).</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Allow the lasagna to rest for about 10 minutes before serving. This helps it set and makes it easier to cut into neat slices.</li>
        </ol>
