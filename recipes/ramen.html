        <!-- Description -->
        <p>
            Ramen is a popular Japanese noodle soup dish that consists of wheat noodles served in a flavorful broth. 
            The broth can be made from various bases, such as chicken, pork, or vegetable stock, and is often 
            seasoned with soy sauce or miso. Ramen is typically garnished with a variety of toppings, including sliced 
            meat (like pork or chicken), soft-boiled eggs, green onions, nori (seaweed), and vegetables like bok choy 
            or mushrooms. It's a comforting and versatile dish enjoyed by many around the world.
